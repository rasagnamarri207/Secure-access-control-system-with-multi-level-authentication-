# 🔐 Secure Access Control System with Multi-Level Authentication

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Secure Access Control System with Multi-Level Authentication** is an embedded security system designed to prevent unauthorized access by verifying a user through **three levels of authentication**:

**User ID → Password → Fingerprint**

Access is granted only when all three authentication levels are successfully verified. The system is developed using the **LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller** and integrates a keypad, LCD, EEPROM, fingerprint module, UART communication, and motor-based door mechanism.

## 🔑 Authentication Process

The system performs authentication in the following sequence:

```text
             ┌───────────────┐
             │    USER ID    │
             └───────┬───────┘
                     ↓
             ┌───────────────┐
             │   PASSWORD    │
             └───────┬───────┘
                     ↓
             ┌───────────────┐
             │  FINGERPRINT  │
             └───────┬───────┘
                     ↓
          ┌─────────────────────┐
          │ AUTHENTICATION      │
          │     SUCCESS?        │
          └──────┬───────┬──────┘
                 │ YES   │ NO
                 ↓       ↓
          ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
          │  ACCESS  │  │  ACCESS  │
          │ GRANTED  │  │  DENIED  │
          └────┬─────┘  └──────────┘
               ↓
          ┌──────────┐
          │DOOR/MOTOR│
          │ ACTIVATED│
          └──────────┘

## ⚙️ Working Principle

### 1. User ID Verification

Initially, the system waits for the user to enter a **User ID using the 4×4 keypad**.

### 2. Password Verification

After receiving the User ID, the system requests the password.

The entered password is compared with the password stored in **AT25C256 EEPROM**. If the passwords match, the system proceeds to fingerprint authentication.

### 3. Fingerprint Verification

The R305 fingerprint module captures the user's fingerprint and searches its stored fingerprint library for a matching template.

The fingerprint process includes:

1. Capture fingerprint image.
2. Generate a character file.
3. Search the fingerprint library.
4. Compare the captured fingerprint with stored templates.

If the fingerprint matches the specified ID, authentication is successfully completed.

### 4. Door Control

After successful authentication at all three levels, the system activates the door mechanism.

The **DC motor rotates forward to represent door opening**. Reverse rotation represents door closing/locked status.

                     │
                     ↓
                 Door Closes
```

The project document specifies that failed authentication results in a failure message on the LCD and the system returns to waiting for User ID input.

## 🔧 Password Management

The system also supports password modification.

The password editing process is:

```text
Enter Current Password
          ↓
   Verify Password
          ↓
   Enter New Password
          ↓
 Confirm New Password
          ↓
 New Password == Confirm?
       ┌──┴──┐
      YES    NO
       │      │
       ↓      ↓
 Save to    Keep Old
 EEPROM     Password
```

The new password is stored in EEPROM only when the new password and confirmation password match.

---

## 👆 Fingerprint Management

The system supports fingerprint management through:

* **Fingerprint Enrollment**
* **Fingerprint Deletion**
* **Fingerprint Search/Verification**

During enrollment, the fingerprint image is captured, converted into a character file, and stored as a template in the fingerprint module's flash library.
